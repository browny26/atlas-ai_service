The **legacy AI module** of Atlas was built with **Python** and used **Ollama Mistral** to generate intelligent travel suggestions.  
The module exposes **REST endpoints using Flask**, which are called by the Java/Spring backend to provide AI-powered itinerary recommendations. 

Key points of the legacy AI module:

- Ran **locally** and implemented in **Python** with **Ollama Mistral**
- Exposes **REST endpoints via Flask** for backend integration  
- Generated **personalized travel suggestions** based on user preferences
- Was integrated with the backend for testing AI-assisted itinerary planning
- Deprecated in favor of **Groq + OpenAI** for scalability, cloud deployment, and more advanced AI features

This module remains part of the project history as a reference for the initial AI implementation.
